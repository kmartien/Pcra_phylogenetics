# bwa.max.edit.dist (-n) : Maximum edit distance if the value is INT, or the fraction of missing 
#     alignments given 2% uniform base error rate if FLOAT. In the latter case, the 
#     maximum edit distance is automatically chosen for different read lengths. [0.04]
# bwa.max.gap.opens (-o) : Maximum number of gap opens [1]
# bwa.max.gap.exentsions (-e) : Maximum number of gap extensions, -1 for 
#     k-difference mode (disallowing long gaps) [-1]
# bwa.deletion.disallow (-d) : Disallow a long deletion within INT bp towards the 3?-end [16]
# bwa.indel.disallow (-i) : Disallow an indel within INT bp towards the ends [5]
# bwa.seed.length (-l) : Take the first INT subsequence as seed. If INT is larger than the query 
#     sequence, seeding will be disabled. For long reads, this option is typically 
#     ranged from 25 to 35 for ?-k 2?. [inf]
# bwa.max.seed.edit.distance (-k) : Maximum edit distance in the seed [2]
# bwa.num.threads (-t) : Number of threads (multi-threading mode) [1]

# bwa.gap.open.penalty (-O) : Gap open penalty [11]
# bwa.gap.extension.penalty (-E) : Gap extension penalty [4]

#  ra.min.reads (--minReadsAtLocus) : The minimum coverage at a locus for the entropy calculation to be enabled; default=4
#  ra.window.size (--windowSize) : Any two SNP calls and/or high entropy positions are considered clustered when they occur 
#      no more than N basepairs apart; default=10
#  ra.mismatch.frac (--mismatchFraction) : Fraction of total sum of base qualities at a position that need to mismatch for the 
#      position to be considered to have high entropy; default=0.15; to disable, set to <= 0 or > 1
#      Note that this fraction should be adjusted based on your particular data set. For deep coverage 
#      and/or when looking for indels with low allele frequency, this number should be smaller.
#  ra.max.interval.size (--maxIntervalSize) : Max size in bp of intervals that we'll pass to the realigner; default=500
#      Because the realignment algorithm is N^2, allowing too large an interval might take too long 
#      to completely realign.
#  ra.LOD (-LOD) : LOD threshold above which the realigner will proceed to realign; default=5.0
#      This term is equivalent to "significance" - i.e. is the improvement significant enough to 
#      merit realignment? Note that this number should be adjusted based on your particular data set.
#      For low coverage and/or when looking for indels with low allele frequency, this number should be smaller.

#     BAQ is the Phred-scaled probability of a read base being misaligned. 
#     Applying this option greatly helps to reduce false SNPs caused by misalignments (default = T)
# mp.mismatch.qual.downgrade (-C) : Coefficient for downgrading mapping quality for reads containing excessive mismatches. 
#     Given a read with a phred-scaled probability q of being generated from the mapped position, 
#     the new mapping quality is about sqrt((INT-q)/INT)*INT. A zero value disables 
#     this functionality; if enabled, the recommended value for BWA is 50 (default = 0)
# mp.min.map.qual (-q) : Minimum mapping quality for an alignment to be used in the consensus (default = 0)
# mp.min.base.qual (-Q) : Minimum base quality for a base to be considered in the consensus (default = 13)
# mp.gap.open.error.prob (-o) : Phred-scaled gap open sequencing error probability.
#     Reducing INT leads to more indel calls. (default = 40)
# mp.gap.extension.error.prob (-e) : Phred-scaled gap extension sequencing error probability. 
#     Reducing leads to longer indels. (default = 20)
# mp.homopolymer.error.coef (-h) : Coefficient for modeling homopolymer errors. Given an l-long homopolymer run, 
#     the sequencing error of an indel of size s is modeled as INT * s/l. (default = 100)
# mp.no.indels (-I) : Do not perform INDEL calling (default = F)

# fasta.min.freq : Minimum frequency of either the reference or alternate base for calling. 
#      If both bases are below this frequency, an N is assigned.
# fasta.min.freq.cov : Minimum coverage above which fasta.min.freq is applied. Sites below this and >= than 
#      fasta.min.cov will only be called if all reads agree.

  snp.num.threads = params$num.threads
)
# snp.min.site.call.qual - the minimum phred-scaled Qscore threshold to separate high
#     confidence from low confidence calls.  Only genotypes with confidence >= this threshold are 
#     emitted as called sites. A reasonable threshold is 30 for high-pass calling (this is the default). 
#     Note that the confidence (QUAL) values for multi-sample low-pass (e.g. 4x per sample) calling 
#     might be significantly smaller with the new EXACT model than with our older GRID_SEARCH model, 
#     as the latter tended to over-estimate the confidence; for low-pass calling we tend to use much 
#     smaller thresholds (e.g. 4).
# snp.min.site.emit.qual - the minimum phred-scaled Qscore threshold to emit low confidence calls. 
#     Genotypes with confidence >= this but less than the calling threshold are emitted but marked as filtered.
#     The default value is 30.
# snp.min.base.qual - specifies the minimum base quality required to consider a base for calling. Default is 17.
# snp.min.map.qual - specifies the minimum read mapping quality required to consider a read for calling. 
#     Only used in indel calling. Default is 20.
# snp.max.coverage - specifies the maximum coverage at a locus for any given sample. Downsampled reads are 
#     randomly selected from all possible reads at a locus. The default is 250 reads.
